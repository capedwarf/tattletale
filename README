This is a CapeDwarf Green based example app.
It can be run in three flavors (branches) - CapeDwarf, GAE or JEE.
By default (in master) we use CapeDwarf, to test CapeDwarf Blue.

Note: client module needs Google Maps to be manually installed into local Maven repo
(see main and client pom.xml for more details)
